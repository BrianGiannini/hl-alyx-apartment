If you can, please credit me if you use any of these in a map.
Making these does take time and effort!

===========

The combine truck gun more or less as seen towards the end of the main game. Includes a custom version with simply a few more settings like the ability to fire custom props!

How to:
  1. Drag .vmap file to <SDK>/content/hlvr/maps/prefabs
  2. From withing hammer, click prefab tab, find the prefabs and drag them onto the floor and position and rotate if necessary.
  3. For shooting custom props simply place the prop at the muzzle, change the 'Projectile' property to its name and uncheck 'Keep original projectile'. Increase speed for larger props.

PS: Ctrl+Shift+F2 hides trigger volumes.
